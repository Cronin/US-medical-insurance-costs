For this project, I investigate a medical insurance costs dataset in a .csv file using the Python skills that I developed during the first lessons.

# Project Goals:
- Work locally on your own computer
- Import a dataset into your program
- Analyze a dataset by building out functions or class methods
- Use libraries to assist in your analysis
